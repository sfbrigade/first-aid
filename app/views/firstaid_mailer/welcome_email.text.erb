Thank You <%= @user.first_name %>!
=================================

We can not thank you enough for your support of Firs+Aid! Together we can help to begin the healing process for those who are effected by a natural disaster.

Many local charities that are involved in community outreach are stretched to the breaking point when a natural disaster hits. Your donations will ensure that they have the resources they need to continue to provide for their communities during a natural disaster and beyond.

If you have just signed up because of a natural disaster, please donate to a local charity in the area of the disaster. If you have just signed up to be ready, please consider donating to a local charity in your area.
